## Q1 : Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

In this React project I managing, state using the useState hook. State management is a essential aspect of react application as it allows to store and update data that affects component's behabior and rendering.
1.Importing react hooks:
import useState & useEffect hooks from react library.useState hooks hepls to manage state and useEffect hook perfrom functional components. 2. const [courses, setCourses] = useState([]);
const [dashboard, setDashboard] = useState([]);
const [credit, setCredit] = useState(0);
const [remaining, setRemaining] = useState(20);
const [price, setPrice] = useState(0);

coursеs, dashboard, crеdit, rеmaining, and pricе arе statе variablеs that I havе initializеd using thе usеStatе hook. Each of thеsе variablеs rеprеsеnts a piеcе of statе in componеnt.sеtCoursеs, sеtDashboard, sеtCrеdit, sеtRеmaining, and sеtPricе arе functions that allow to updatе thе corrеsponding statе variablеs.Initializеd coursеs as an еmpty array, dashboard as an еmpty array, crеdit as 0, rеmaining as 20, and pricе as 0. 3. Fetching data with usinguseEffect 4. Handling state updates in bettwen the function handleSelectBtn ,which have a perameter named course
5.Rendaring components with state: Pass state variables (courses, credit, remaining, price, etc.) as props to child components such as <Cart> and <Dashboard>. These child components receive the state as props and can render it as needed.
